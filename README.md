FILELESS MALWARE DETECTION:
Fileless malware is a type of malicious software that uses legitimate programs to infect a computer. It does not rely on files and leaves no footprint, making it challenging to detect and remove. ... Frodo, Number of the Beast, and The Dark Avenger were all early examples of this type of malware. Detection techniques for Fileless malware. In the case of fileless malware, PowerShell and WMI could be used to reconnaissance, establishing persistence, lateral movement, remote command execution, and file transfer, make it difficult to track evidence left behind during a compromise. While attackers don’t have to install code to launch a fileless malware attack, they still need to get access to the environment so they can modify its native tools to serve their purposes. Access and attacks can be accomplished in several ways, such as through the use of:
Exploit kits,
Hijacked native tools,
Registry resident malware,
Memory-only malware,
Fileless ransomware,
Stolen credentials.
Registry resident malware is malware that installs itself in the Windows registry in order to remain persistent while evading detection.
Commonly, Windows systems are infected through the use of a dropper program that downloads a malicious file. This malicious file remains active on the targeted system, which makes it vulnerable to detection by antivirus software. Fileless malware may also use a dropper program, but it doesn’t download a malicious file. Instead, the dropper program itself writes malicious code straight into the Windows registry. The malicious code can be programmed to launch every time the OS is launched, and there is no malicious file that could be discovered – the malicious code is hidden in native files not subject to AV detection. The oldest variant of this type of attack is Poweliks, but many have emerged since then, including Kovter and GootKit. Malware that modifies registry keys is highly likely to remain in place undetected for extended periods of time.
